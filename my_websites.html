    <h1>My Websites</h1>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> Hi! My name is Mykola Tokar. I am a Junior Student at Illinois Institute of Technology where
      I am studing Information Technology and Management.
    </p>
    <p> I like web development and continuously learn new features about it.
      As for me, I think it is unbelievable when simple web page can be addictive as drugs or educative as real teacher.
      For example, I think everyone expirienced 2 hours scrolling of instagram with no purpose and from the other side you can read
      20 page long article about molecular physics if it is presented with beautiful animation around.
      So, I hope some day I will be able to create such cool web content like instagram or New York Times News web page
      but now you can check some of my work that I already created.
    </p>
    <p>If you want to check my music preferences you can listen a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBleNfmkScA">track</a> from one of my favorite artist(Oxxxymiron).</p>

    <h2>Hard coded website</h2>
    <p>I created this website on Introduction to Web Development course.
      One of my friend asked my to create this website for his company and I used it as my final project.
      This is a website for construction company and I tried to put all necessary information about the company.
      The website contains five webpages with different content, so if it is looks interesting for you,
      you can follow the link after this description.  <a href="https://tokarm.github.io/QuellaConstruction/">Link</a></p>

  <section id="wix">
    <h2>Wix.com website</h2>
    <p> When I first time heard about wix.com my initial thought was that it is absolutely useless to create a website on framework like this.
      However, I decided to try build something on it. Now I think it is pretty good solution for small businesses when content of the website is simple description of the company.
      So, I spent some time playing with and created a small website for "imaginary" electrical contractor company.
      If you want to visit this website please follow a link after this description <a href="https://www.sidesparky.com/">Link</a></p>
