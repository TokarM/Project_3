    <h1>My Programs</h1>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> Hi! My name is Mykola Tokar. I am a Junior Student at Illinois Institute of Technology where
      I am studing Information Technology and Management.
    </p>
    <p> The main thing what I like about programming is solving problems. As for my, programming is something that super hard to begin but when you started it is becomes really hard to stop.
      There is always an issue with something and every time you are solving a small problem your brain getting a small dose of dopamine which is pretty enjoyable.
      If to speak about what kind of programming am I like or what languages I would say ".NET Framework and Java programming language are my best friends". Right after this introduction you will find couple programs that I personally created.
    </p>
    <p> Here is another Oxxxymiron's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNTL8XkV7-4">track</a>.:)</p>

  <section id="cafe_program">
    <h2>Cafe Program for calculations (.NET C#)</h2>
    <p> This program I created on one of my programming courses. Basically, this program can be used in any cafe or restaurant for calculation purposes.
        The main function of "Cafe Program" is to calculate the total amount to pay for any order. Another functionality of this program is that user can change price for any product
        without any interaction with actual code. Also, since this program read the data from .CSV file if user has his/her own menu he/she can easily replace default .CSV file by a new one (with appropriate structure)
        and program will use new menu next time you open it. So, if you want to download this program there is a link to my repository on GitHub right after this description.

    <h2>Java Program</h2>
    <p> This is my Java program on which I am currently working on. This is going to be three stage project for Intermediate Software Development course which I am currently taking.
      Basically, for now this program just take a .CSV file, read first 25 records from it, and display them on console.
      So, if you want to download this program there is a link to my repository on GitHub right after this description.
